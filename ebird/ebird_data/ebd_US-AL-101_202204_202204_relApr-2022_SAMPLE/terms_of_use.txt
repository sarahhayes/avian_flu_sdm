eBird Data Access

Terms of Use

Building and managing the systems that enable the collection and careful management of data in eBird requires ongoing time, effort, and expense for the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Thousands of participants freely provide the data to eBird, and in this same spirit we make these data freely available for non-commercial use.

In order to help financially maintain and develop eBird, we need to receive acknowledgement for our work when others use these data for non-commercial purposes. The formal terms of use (specified below) describe the mechanisms through which we can ensure that appropriate credit is given for the benefit of maintaining and growing eBird.
