plot(abd_breeding, axes = FALSE)
#This doesn't work - vignette explains why!

# Part of the reason is that will do a global map unless we crop
# boundary polygon for michigan
mi <- ne_states(iso_a2 = "US", returnclass = "sf") %>% 
  filter(postal == "MI") %>% 
  # project to same coordinate reference system as the raster data

# crop data to michigan

# map the cropped data

## Next section in vignette talks about the projection of the data

# Projection
# The raster data are all provided in the same equal area sinusoidal projection as
# NASA MODIS data. While this projection is suitable for analysis, 
# it is not ideal for mapping since it introduces significant distortion. 
# Instead, as part of the Status and Trends workflow, custom species-specific 
# projections are provided that are optimized for the region that the species 
# occurs within. We can access the projection for Yellow-bellied Sapsucker with
# load_fac_map_parameters(), then transform the raster data to this 
# custom projection.

# load the mapping parameters
fac_parameters <- load_fac_map_parameters(path)
crs <- fac_parameters$custom_projection

# transform to the custom projection using nearest neighbor resampling
abd_projected <- project(abd_breeding_mi, crs, method = "near")

# map the cropped and projected data
plot(abd_projected, axes = FALSE)

# change the bins for the abundance

# quantiles of non-zero values
v <- values(abd_projected)
v <- v[!is.na(v) & v > 0]
bins <- quantile(v, seq(0, 1, by = 0.1))
# add a bin for 0
bins <- c(0, bins)

# status and trends palette
pal <- abundance_palette(length(bins) - 2)
# add a color for zero
pal <- c("#e6e6e6", pal)

# map using the quantile bins
plot(abd_projected, breaks = bins, col = pal, axes = FALSE)


# Finally, weâ€™ll add state and country boundaries to provide some context. 
# The R package rnaturalearth is an excellent source of attribution 
# free contextual GIS data.
